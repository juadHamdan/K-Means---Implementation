```
Two datasets are attached to this assignment: 
(1) a set of sentences used to train the ATIS (Airline Travel Information System) chatbot, 
and (2) a small subset of the dataset used for training another chat-bot including only 3 topics. 
Both datasets come with annotated categories â€“ these labels only used for evaluation.

Evaluation is preformed with the RI and ARI metrics.
